# Predictive-Modeling-for-Diabetes-Detection
This project explores predictive modeling techniques for diabetes detection. It encompasses data exploration and preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of tree-based methods (including bagging, random forest, and boosting), support vector machines with various kernels and hyperparameters, as well as dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and clustering. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance, and results are interpreted to provide insights into diabetes prediction.
